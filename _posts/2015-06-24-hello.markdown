This site serves as the home for Trivial Data -- a consulting partnership focused on Social Practice, Art, Design, and Technology. In the coming weeks you'll be able to see more about our past projects [Joyography](/joyography/), [Affirmation Hotline](/affirmation-hotline/), and [Are You Your Work](/are-you-your-work/).

In time, all of our results and figures will be posted to github for you to manipulate. But don't worry. They'll all be trivial.
